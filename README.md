## About The Project

Invoice Processing System is not something new we've heard of. However, this project let you run the server locally for the client side as well as server side and can be used to note down the pending invoices in an effective way by storing them on mysql database installed on your computer only by using minimal frontend as necessary and no bloatware.  

Here's why:

* No need to use third party application to remember the pending invoices.
* Saves your pocket money since many platform are paid nowadays.
* Helps you understand technical part of web development only if you dig inside the code part.

## Built With
